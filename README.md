# AIfutures
ART project for GRT10 Hackathon

A series of generative art pieces created using AI/machine learning. I started with found images and manipulated them using GANbreeder, a tool that implements Generative Adversarial Networks to generate images based on user inputs. My intent was to contemplate the role and effect of AI on future crypto and blockchain projects and communities, and explore the possible futures and their emotional and societal impact through visual imagery; reflect on how the AI future(s) might 'feel'.
